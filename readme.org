* Clustering Coefficients

** Building the program
   To build the assign2Graph executable, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make
  #+END_SRC

** Running the program
   To calculate the clustering coefficient of a graph found in /filename/ using
   /k/ threads:
  #+NAME: usage
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :export code
  ./assign2Graph filename k
  #+END_SRC

  To run the benchmarks, writing results to /networkDatasets/HcNetwork_bench.csv/, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make bench
  #+END_SRC

  To regenerate this document with new benchmark results, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make pdf
  #+END_SRC
** Results
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args: :exports results :results value
  :END:
  Below are the results of running the assign2Graph executable on the
  file /networkDatasets/HcNetwork.txt/ with various numbers of threads.
  The running time for each thread is averaged over 10 trials.
  Note that running with 1 thread is simply serial, and does not involve
  using any pthreads, mutexes, or barriers.

  csv_data.insert(1, None) # to get nice headers in org table
  return csv_data
