* Clustering Coefficients

** Building the program
   To build the assign2Graph executable, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make graph
  #+END_SRC

** Running the program
   To calculate the clustering coefficient of a graph found in /filename/ using
   /k/ threads:
  #+NAME: usage
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :export code
  ./assign2Graph filename k
  #+END_SRC

  To run the benchmarks, writing results to /networkDatasets/HcNetwork_bench.csv/, run
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make bench
  #+END_SRC

  To regenerate this document with new benchmark results, run either
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make doc
  #+END_SRC
  or simply
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  make
  #+END_SRC

** Results
   :PROPERTIES:
   :header-args: :exports results :results table
   :END:
  #+NAME: run_bench
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import run_bench
  csv_data = run_bench.main()
  csv_data.insert(1, None) # to get nice headers in org table
  return csv_data
  #+END_SRC

  Below are the results of running the assign2Graph executable on the
  file /networkDatasets/HcNetwork.txt/ with various numbers of threads.
  Note that running with 1 thread is simply serial, and does not involve
  using any pthreads.
